## About Me
My name is Taylor and I live in Norman, Oklahoma. I was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas but came to Oklahoma in 2014 to attend college at the University of Oklahoma, met my (now) husband, and never left! I love reading, music, and taking my puppy, Oliver, on walks. Fun fact: I love 5Ks and I plan to do one every month this year!

## Past Coding Experience
Most of my experience is in social media and print media, but I have done  some website design. Mostly through platforms like Squarespace, GoDaddy, and Wild Apricot, so not a lot of backend work apart from the courses required for my Art & Technology BFA in undergrad. During those courses we did learn the basics of HTML and CSS so I know enough to at least decipher what I'm seeing usually.

## Career Goals
1. Find a good "sustain me" job
2. Finish my MA at University of Florida
3. Continue working at my "sustain me" job while expanding my small wedding stationery business
4. Eventually go full time as a small business owner
